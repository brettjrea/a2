Sure, I understand that you need a concise and organized study plan for your Regents 2 exam focusing on algebra and functions. I'll outline the subjects by grouping them into related topics, making it easier for you to study efficiently.

### Algebra (35% - 44% of the exam)
1. **Real Number System & Quantities (Major)**
   - Extend properties of exponents to rational exponents
   - Reason quantitatively and use units to solve problems

2. **Complex Number System (Additional)**
   - Perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers
   - Use complex numbers in polynomial identities and equations

3. **Seeing Structure in Expressions (Major)**
   - Interpret the structure of expressions
   - Write expressions in equivalent forms to solve problems

4. **Arithmetic with Polynomials and Rational Expressions (Additional/Supporting)**
   - Use polynomial identities to solve problems
   - Rewrite rational expressions

5. **Creating & Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities (Major/Additional/Supporting)**
   - Create and solve equations and inequalities in one variable
   - Solve systems of equations
   - Represent and solve graphically

6. **Expressing Geometric Properties with Equations (Additional)**
   - Translate between geometric description and equations for conic sections

### Functions (30% - 40% of the exam)
1. **Understanding Functions (Supporting)**
   - Understand the concept of a function
   - Use function notation

2. **Interpreting Functions (Major/Supporting)**
   - Interpret functions that arise in applications
   - Analyze functions using different representations

3. **Building Functions (Major/Additional)**
   - Build functions that model relationships
   - Build new functions from existing ones

4. **Linear, Quadratic, and Exponential Models (Supporting/Additional)**
   - Construct and compare models
   - Interpret expressions for functions

5. **Trigonometric Functions (Additional)**
   - Extend domain using unit circle
   - Model periodic phenomena
   - Prove and apply trigonometric identities

### Statistics & Probability (14% - 21% of the exam)
1. **Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data (Additional/Supporting)**
   - Summarize, represent, and interpret data

2. **Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions (Major/Supporting)**
   - Understand and evaluate random processes
   - Make inferences and justify conclusions from studies

3. **Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability (Additional)**
   - Understand independence and conditional probability
   - Use the rules of probability to compute probabilities

Remember to allocate your study time based on the emphasis of each topic. Focus on the "Major" categories and algebra/functions, but don't ignore the "Additional" and "Supporting" categories, as they can still be significant parts of the exam. Good luck with your studies!
