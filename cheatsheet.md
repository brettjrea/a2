Certainly! Here's a cheat sheet that summarizes key concepts from the algebra and functions topics. It's designed to help you quickly review essential ideas and formulas, but make sure to follow your exam's guidelines regarding the use of cheat sheets or other aids.

### Algebra Cheat Sheet

#### Real Number System
- **Rational Exponents**: \(a^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}\)
- **Properties of Exponents**: \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\)

#### Complex Numbers
- **Arithmetic**: \((a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i\)
- **Polar Form**: \(r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)\)

#### Polynomials
- **Factoring**: Recognize common factors, difference of squares, trinomials
- **Rational Expressions**: Simplify by factoring numerator and denominator

#### Equations & Inequalities
- **Solving Linear Equations**: Use inverse operations
- **Solving Quadratic Equations**: Quadratic formula: \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\)
- **Graphical Solutions**: Utilize the intersection of graphs

### Functions Cheat Sheet

#### Understanding Functions
- **Function Notation**: \(f(x) = y\), \(f(a) = b\)
- **Domain & Range**: Understand the inputs and outputs

#### Interpreting Functions
- **Different Representations**: Graphical, numerical, algebraic
- **Context Interpretation**: Understand function in terms of real-world situation

#### Building & Transforming Functions
- **Building Functions**: Combine basic functions using arithmetic operations
- **Transformations**: Vertical shift, horizontal shift, reflections, stretches

#### Linear, Quadratic, Exponential Models
- **Linear**: \(y = mx + b\)
- **Quadratic**: \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\)
- **Exponential**: \(y = ab^x\)

#### Trigonometry
- **Basic Identities**: \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\)
- **Unit Circle**: Know key values and relationships

This cheat sheet doesn't cover every detail but provides a quick reference to key concepts. Personalize it based on your specific needs and understanding, and remember to comply with your testing center's policies.
