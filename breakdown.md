### Algebra (35% - 44% of the exam)
1. **Real Number System & Quantities (Major)**
   - Extend properties of exponents to rational exponents
   - Reason quantitatively and use units to solve problems

Here is an example that demonstrates how to extend the properties of exponents to rational exponents and reason quantitatively:

Let's say we have the expression `8^(2/3)`. We can rewrite this expression as `(8^(1/3))^2` by using the property that `a^(m/n) = (a^(1/n))^m`. This means that we can take the cube root of 8, which is 2, and then square it to get 4. So, `8^(2/3) = 4`.

Now, let's say we want to find the value of `x` that satisfies the equation `x^(3/2) = 27`. We can rewrite this equation as `(x^(1/2))^3 = 27`, which means that the square root of `x` cubed is equal to 27. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get `x^(1/2) = 3`, which means that the square root of `x` is equal to 3. Squaring both sides, we get `x = 9`.

In this example, we used the properties of exponents to rewrite expressions with rational exponents and reasoned quantitatively to solve an equation.

2. **Complex Number System (Additional)**
   - Perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers
   - Use complex numbers in polynomial identities and equations
     
Here is an example that demonstrates how to perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers and use complex numbers in polynomial identities and equations:

Let's say we have the complex numbers `z1 = 3 + 4i` and `z2 = 2 - i`. We can perform arithmetic operations with these complex numbers as follows:
- Addition: `z1 + z2 = (3 + 4i) + (2 - i) = 5 + 3i`
- Subtraction: `z1 - z2 = (3 + 4i) - (2 - i) = 1 + 5i`
- Multiplication: `z1 * z2 = (3 + 4i) * (2 - i) = 6 - 3i + 8i - 4i^2 = 10 + 5i`
- Division: `z1 / z2 = (3 + 4i) / (2 - i) = ((3 + 4i) * (2 + i)) / ((2 - i) * (2 + i)) = (10 + 5i) / (5) = 2 + i`

Now, let's say we have the polynomial identity `(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2`. We can use this identity to expand the square of a complex number. For example, let's expand `(3 + 4i)^2`:
`(3 + 4i)^2 = (3)^2 + 2(3)(4i) + (4i)^2
           = 9 + 24i -16
           = -7 +24i`

In this example, we used arithmetic operations to manipulate complex numbers and applied a polynomial identity to expand the square of a complex number.

3. **Seeing Structure in Expressions (Major)**
   - Interpret the structure of expressions
   - Write expressions in equivalent forms to solve problems
   - 
Here is an example that demonstrates how to interpret the structure of expressions and write expressions in equivalent forms to solve problems:

Let's say we have the expression `2x^2 + 4x + 2`. We can interpret the structure of this expression as a quadratic trinomial, where the first term is a squared term, the second term is a linear term, and the third term is a constant term.

We can write this expression in an equivalent form by factoring it. To do this, we can use the factoring method of grouping. First, we can factor out a common factor of 2 from all terms to get `2(x^2 + 2x + 1)`. Then, we can factor the quadratic trinomial inside the parentheses as `(x + 1)^2`. So, our final factored form is `2(x + 1)^2`.

In this example, we interpreted the structure of an expression and wrote it in an equivalent form by factoring it. This can be useful for solving equations or simplifying expressions.

4. **Arithmetic with Polynomials and Rational Expressions (Additional/Supporting)**
   - Use polynomial identities to solve problems
   - Rewrite rational expressions

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use polynomial identities to solve problems and rewrite rational expressions:

Let's say we have the polynomial identity `(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2`. We can use this identity to expand the square of a binomial. For example, let's expand `(3x + 4)^2`:
`(3x + 4)^2 = (3x)^2 + 2(3x)(4) + (4)^2
           = 9x^2 + 24x + 16`

Now, let's say we have the rational expression `(x^2 - 1) / (x - 1)`. We can rewrite this expression in an equivalent form by factoring the numerator and canceling common factors. To do this, we can factor the numerator as `(x - 1)(x + 1)` and cancel the common factor of `(x - 1)` to get `(x - 1)(x + 1) / (x - 1) = x + 1`.

In this example, we used a polynomial identity to expand the square of a binomial and rewrote a rational expression in an equivalent form by factoring and canceling common factors.

5. **Creating & Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities (Major/Additional/Supporting)**
   - Create and solve equations and inequalities in one variable
   - Solve systems of equations
   - Represent and solve graphically

Here is an example that demonstrates how to create and solve equations and inequalities in one variable, solve systems of equations, and represent and solve graphically:

Let's say we want to find the value of `x` that satisfies the equation `2x + 3 = 7`. We can solve this equation by subtracting 3 from both sides to get `2x = 4`, and then dividing both sides by 2 to get `x = 2`.

Now, let's say we have the system of equations `x + y = 3` and `2x - y = 4`. We can solve this system by adding the two equations to eliminate the `y` variable: `(x + y) + (2x - y) = 3 + 4`, which simplifies to `3x = 7`, so `x = 7/3`. Substituting this value of `x` into the first equation, we get `(7/3) + y = 3`, so `y = 2/3`.

We can also represent and solve this system graphically by plotting the two lines `y = -x + 3` and `y = 2x - 4` on the same coordinate plane. The point where the two lines intersect is the solution to the system, which in this case is `(7/3, 2/3)`.

In this example, we created and solved an equation in one variable, solved a system of equations algebraically and graphically.

6. **Expressing Geometric Properties with Equations (Additional)**
   - Translate between geometric description and equations for conic sections

Here is an example that demonstrates how to translate between a geometric description and an equation for a conic section:

Let's say we have a circle with center at the point `(3, 4)` and radius of `5` units. We can translate this geometric description into an equation for the circle by using the standard form of the equation of a circle: `(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2`, where `(h, k)` is the center of the circle and `r` is its radius.

Substituting the values for the center and radius into this equation, we get `(x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 5^2`, which simplifies to `(x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 25`. This is the equation of the circle in standard form.

In this example, we translated a geometric description of a circle into an equation for the circle by using the standard form of the equation of a circle.

### Functions (30% - 40% of the exam)
1. **Understanding Functions (Supporting)**
   - Understand the concept of a function
   - Use function notation

4Here is an example that demonstrates the concept of a function and the use of function notation:

A function is a mathematical relationship between two sets of numbers, where each element in the first set (called the domain) is paired with exactly one element in the second set (called the range). For example, let's say we have a function `f` that takes a number `x` as input and outputs the square of `x`. We can write this function using function notation as `f(x) = x^2`.

Using this function, we can find the output for any input value by substituting the input value into the function. For example, if we want to find the output for the input value `3`, we can substitute `3` into the function to get `f(3) = 3^2 = 9`. This means that when the input to the function `f` is `3`, the output is `9`.

In this example, we defined a function using function notation and used it to find the output for a given input value.
 

3. **Building Functions (Major/Additional)**
   - Build functions that model relationships
   - Build new functions from existing ones

Here is an example that demonstrates how to build functions that model relationships and build new functions from existing ones:

Let's say we have a set of data points that represent the relationship between the height and weight of a group of people. We can use this data to build a function that models the relationship between height and weight. One way to do this is by using linear regression to find the line of best fit for the data. This line can be represented by the equation `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope of the line and `b` is the y-intercept.

Once we have found the equation for the line of best fit, we can use it to build a new function that predicts the weight of a person given their height. For example, let's say our line of best fit has the equation `y = 0.5x + 100`. We can define a new function `f` that takes a person's height as input and outputs their predicted weight as `f(x) = 0.5x + 100`.

In this example, we used data to build a function that models a relationship and then used that function to build a new function that makes predictions based on the relationship.

4. **Linear, Quadratic, and Exponential Models (Supporting/Additional)**
   - Construct and compare models
   - Interpret expressions for functions
Here is an example that demonstrates how to construct and compare linear, quadratic, and exponential models, and interpret expressions for functions:

Let's say we have a set of data points that represent the growth of a population over time. We can use this data to construct linear, quadratic, and exponential models that predict the population at a given time.

A linear model might have the form `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope of the line and `b` is the y-intercept. This model assumes that the population grows at a constant rate over time.

A quadratic model might have the form `y = ax^2 + bx + c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. This model assumes that the population growth rate changes over time in a predictable way.

An exponential model might have the form `y = ab^x`, where `a` and `b` are constants. This model assumes that the population grows at an exponential rate over time.

We can compare these models by calculating their predictions for the population at different times and comparing those predictions to the actual data. We can also use statistical methods to determine which model provides the best fit to the data.

In this example, we constructed linear, quadratic, and exponential models to predict population growth and compared their predictions to actual data.

5. **Trigonometric Functions (Additional)**
   - Extend domain using unit circle
   - Model periodic phenomena
   - Prove and apply trigonometric identities
     
Here is an example that demonstrates how to extend the domain of trigonometric functions using the unit circle, model periodic phenomena, and prove and apply trigonometric identities:

The unit circle is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of the coordinate plane. We can use the unit circle to extend the domain of trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine to include all real numbers, not just angles between 0 and 360 degrees.

For example, let's say we want to find the value of `sin(390 degrees)`. We can use the unit circle to see that `390 degrees` is equivalent to `30 degrees` because `390 = 360 + 30`. So, `sin(390 degrees) = sin(30 degrees) = 0.5`.

Trigonometric functions can also be used to model periodic phenomena such as the motion of a pendulum or the changing of the seasons. For example, let's say we have a pendulum that swings back and forth with a period of 2 seconds. We can model the horizontal position of the pendulum over time using the cosine function: `x(t) = cos(pi * t)`, where `t` is time in seconds.

Trigonometric identities are equations that are true for all values of the variables. For example, one common trigonometric identity is the Pythagorean identity: `sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1`. We can use this identity to prove other identities or to simplify expressions involving trigonometric functions.

In this example, we used the unit circle to extend the domain of trigonometric functions, modeled periodic phenomena using trigonometric functions, and proved and applied a trigonometric identity.

### Statistics & Probability (14% - 21% of the exam)
1. **Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data (Additional/Supporting)**
   - Summarize, represent, and interpret data
   - 
Here is an example of interpreting categorical and quantitative data:

Suppose a botanist walks around a local forest and measures the height of a certain species of plant. The variable "plant height" is a quantitative variable because it takes on numerical values. For example, the height could be 15 inches, 17.5 inches, 19.2 inches, etc¹.

On the other hand, suppose a researcher surveys 200 people and asks them about their favorite vacation location. The variable "vacation location" is a categorical variable because it takes on names. For example, responses could include “Miami”, “San Francisco”, “Hilton Head”, etc¹.

To summarize and represent this data, we can use different methods for each type of variable. For categorical variables, we can use frequency tables to show the number of observations in each category. For quantitative variables, we can use descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, range, interquartile range, and standard deviation to summarize the data¹.

2. **Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions (Major/Supporting)**
   - Understand and evaluate random processes
   - Make inferences and justify conclusions from studies

Here is an example of making inferences and justifying conclusions:

Suppose a researcher wants to study the effectiveness of a new drug in treating a certain disease. The researcher conducts a randomized controlled trial, where participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group (receiving the new drug) or the control group (receiving a placebo). After the study is completed, the researcher collects data on the health outcomes of the participants.

To make inferences and justify conclusions from this study, the researcher can use statistical methods to analyze the data. For example, they can use hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant difference in health outcomes between the treatment and control groups. If the results show that there is a significant difference, the researcher can conclude that the new drug is effective in treating the disease.

In addition, the researcher can use confidence intervals to estimate the true effect of the new drug. A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true effect, based on the data collected in the study. The researcher can use this information to make more precise conclusions about the effectiveness of the new drug.

3. **Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability (Additional)**
   - Understand independence and conditional probability
   - Use the rules of probability to compute probabilities

     Here is an example of conditional probability and the rules of probability:

Suppose a school has 100 students, 60 of whom are boys and 40 of whom are girls. Of the boys, 30 play basketball, while 20 of the girls play basketball. We can use this information to compute probabilities using the rules of probability.

First, let's define some events:
- B = student is a boy
- G = student is a girl
- BB = student plays basketball

Using the information given, we can compute the following probabilities:
- P(B) = 60/100 = 0.6 (the probability that a randomly selected student is a boy)
- P(G) = 40/100 = 0.4 (the probability that a randomly selected student is a girl)
- P(BB | B) = 30/60 = 0.5 (the conditional probability that a boy plays basketball, given that the student is a boy)
- P(BB | G) = 20/40 = 0.5 (the conditional probability that a girl plays basketball, given that the student is a girl)

We can also use the rules of probability to compute the probability that a randomly selected student plays basketball, regardless of their gender. This is known as the law of total probability:
P(BB) = P(BB | B) * P(B) + P(BB | G) * P(G) = 0.5 * 0.6 + 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.5

So, the probability that a randomly selected student from this school plays basketball is 0.5.

Remember to allocate your study time based on the emphasis of each topic. Focus on the "Major" categories and algebra/functions, but don't ignore the "Additional" and "Supporting" categories, as they can still be significant parts of the exam. Good luck with your studies!
